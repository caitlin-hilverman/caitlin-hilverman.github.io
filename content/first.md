My name is Caitie Hilverman and I'm a data scientist living in Hudson, NY. I've created this blog as a way to share some of my work. I was trained as a cognitive psychologist studying gesture and memory under Susan Cook and Melissa Duff before transitioning to tech. I now work for a mental health and wellness company called Qntfy. Herein you'll find projects related to my local community of Hudson, gesture and memory work, and personal data science projects.

Thanks for stopping by!
